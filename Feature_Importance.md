**Feature Importance**

Feature importance analysis aims to identify the most significant predictors of mental health outcomes, specifically the crude prevalence of mental health issues (MHLTH_CrudePrev) at the census tract level. By uncovering these key features, we can guide policymakers in designing targeted interventions and allocating resources efficiently. Additionally, this analysis improves the interpretability of machine learning models, bridging the gap between complex algorithms and actionable insights.

**Methodology**

To determine feature importance, we employed both tree-based machine learning models and interpretability tools. The two machine learning models we used are:

Random Forest Regressor - A robust ensemble learning method that uses decision trees to identify the contribution of each feature by its reduction in impurity.

XGBoost Regressor - A gradient-boosted tree model optimized for predictive performance and capable of handling high-dimensional data.

The interpretability tool we used is SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations. It is a model-agnostic interpretability framework that calculates the marginal contribution of each feature to individual predictions, providing both global and local explanations.

The dataset was preprocessed through imputation for missing values, encoding for categorical variables, and standardization of numerical features. The final dataset consisted of 69 features and 5,289 rows after cleaning, imputation, and dimensionality reduction.

**Key Findings**

**Top Features Identified:**

- COGNITION_CrudePrev: Emerged as the most influential predictor in both Random Forest and XGBoost models, with significantly higher importance scores compared to other features. This highlights the critical role of cognitive health in understanding overall mental health prevalence.
- DEPRESSION_CrudePrev: Ranked second, indicating its direct relevance to the target variable.
- CASTHMA_CrudePrev and BINGE_CrudePrev: Features related to comorbid conditions such as asthma and binge drinking showed moderate importance, suggesting their indirect association with mental health issues.
- OBESITY_CrudePrev and DIABETES_CrudePrev: These features were less influential but still noteworthy, underscoring the relationship between physical and mental health.

**Model-Specific Observations:**

- Random Forest attributed over 87% of the importance to COGNITION_CrudePrev, followed by smaller contributions from other features such as depression prevalence and asthma prevalence.
- XGBoost, while agreeing on the top-ranked feature, showed a more distributed importance across the top predictors.

**SHAP Value Insights:**

- SHAP summary plots provided nuanced insights into the directionality of feature contributions. For instance, high values of COGNITION_CrudePrev consistently corresponded to higher predicted prevalence of mental health issues.
- DEPRESSION_CrudePrev and BINGE_CrudePrev also displayed strong positive correlations with the target variable, reinforcing their importance.

**Visualizations**

**Bar Plots**:

- Comparative bar plots of feature importances from Random Forest and XGBoost highlighted **COGNITION_CrudePrev** as the dominant predictor, followed by **DEPRESSION_CrudePrev** and others.

**SHAP Summary Plots**:

- Visualizations of SHAP values illustrated the global and local impacts of top predictors, providing interpretable and actionable insights for decision-makers.

**Implications**

The analysis underscores the critical role of cognitive health and comorbidities in shaping mental health outcomes. Interventions aimed at improving cognitive function and addressing co-occurring conditions like depression and binge drinking could have a substantial impact on reducing the prevalence of mental health issues.

**Actionable Insights**

The feature importance analysis highlights actionable areas to improve mental health outcomes at the census tract level. The following insights can guide public health interventions:

**Focus on Cognitive and Mental Health Comorbidities:**

Cognitive Health (COGNITION_CrudePrev): As the strongest predictor of mental health prevalence, programs targeting cognitive health improvement—such as memory training, mental agility exercises, and support for individuals with cognitive impairments—should be prioritized.

Depression Prevalence (DEPRESSION_CrudePrev): Depression remains a critical determinant. Expanding access to mental health services, promoting early diagnosis, and ensuring community support systems are in place are crucial steps.

**Address Behavioral and Physical Health Factors:**

Asthma and Binge Drinking (CASTHMA_CrudePrev and BINGE_CrudePrev): Behavioral health issues indirectly impact mental health. Educational campaigns and behavioral intervention programs can mitigate their influence.

Physical Health (OBESITY_CrudePrev and DIABETES_CrudePrev): The link between physical and mental health warrants integrated care models that address both simultaneously, such as programs encouraging healthy eating and physical activity.

**Regional Insights for Targeted Interventions:**

Geospatial analysis suggests variation in feature influence across regions. Localized interventions, tailored to the health profiles and environmental factors of specific census tracts, can maximize impact.

**Limitations and Future Work**

While the models provide robust insights, further validation using external datasets and longitudinal studies is recommended to ensure generalizability. Additionally, incorporating spatial analysis could help identify region-specific patterns and hotspots for targeted action.
