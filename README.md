# Mental Health Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the prevalence of poor mental health in neighborhoods using demographic, socioeconomic, and environmental factors. By analyzing community-level data, the model identifies key predictors of mental health outcomes and highlights high-risk areas. The project utilizes data processing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning modeling, and visualization techniques to provide insights into public health challenges and inform targeted interventions.
