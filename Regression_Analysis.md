# Feature Importance and Regression Analysis for Mental Health Prevalence
This analysis examines the relationship between various socio-economic, housing, and mobility features and the prevalence of mental health distress (MHLTH_CrudePrev). Using regression models, the study identifies key factors that either exacerbate or alleviate mental distress, helping policymakers target specific risk factors for intervention.

## Key Findings from Feature Importance and Regression Models
### Regression Models Employed:

1. Linear Regression: Baseline model to understand simple relationships between predictors and mental health outcomes.
2. Ridge Regression: Applies L2 regularization to prevent overfitting by addressing multicollinearity.
3. Lasso Regression: Uses L1 regularization for feature selection, focusing on significant predictors and reducing less important ones.
4. Preprocessing and Assumptions: The dataset, containing 5,289 rows and 76 features, was cleaned and standardized. Categorical variables were one-hot encoded, and multicollinearity was addressed through regularization techniques. Assumptions for linearity, homoscedasticity, and normality were verified.

### Coefficients and Variable Analysis
The regression analysis revealed several key insights:

#### Negative Coefficients (Factors that reduce mental distress):
1. Pct_AO1: Percent of one-car households in the census block group (CBG) in 2018.
2. Pct_AO2p: Percent of two-plus-car households in CBG in 2018.
3. R_HiWageWk: Count of workers earning $3333/month or more in 2017.
4. D4d: Aggregate frequency of transit service [D4c] per square mile.
5. D4c: Frequency of transit service within 0.25 miles of CBG boundary during evening peak periods (2020).
6. D5ar: Jobs within 45 minutes of auto travel time, weighted by time-decay in 2020.
These variables, which reflect household wealth and mobility, show a negative relationship with mental distress, suggesting that higher income, car ownership, and proximity to work are associated with better mental health outcomes.

#### Positive Coefficients (Factors that increase mental distress):
1. P_WrkAge: Percent of the working-age population (18 to 64 years).
2. D3AMM: Network density in terms of multi-modal facility miles per square mile.
3. D3APO: Network density in terms of pedestrian-oriented facility miles per square mile.
4. D4a: Distance from population-weighted centroid to nearest transit stop (2020).
5. D5cr: Proportional accessibility to regional destinations (auto).
6. D5cri: Regional centrality index based on accessibility to regional destinations (auto).
These variables, associated with urban density, mobility, and centrality, indicate that living in more densely populated and developed urban areas increases the risk of mental distress. The negative effects of urbanization, including long commutes, transit service density, and high pedestrian activity, seem to contribute to higher levels of mental health issues.

###Conclusion and Implications
The analysis highlights how socio-economic factors, such as income, car ownership, and proximity to work, contribute to lower mental health distress, emphasizing the importance of household wealth and mobility in promoting mental well-being. Conversely, urbanization and high-density living are linked to higher mental distress, suggesting that factors like crowded environments, limited access to open spaces, and long commutes may have adverse effects on mental health.

These insights can guide public health interventions by focusing on:

1. Improving economic conditions: Programs to increase income and promote car ownership may reduce mental distress.
2. Addressing urban density: Urban planning policies that reduce crowding, improve access to green spaces, and provide better public transport may mitigate the negative effects of living in densely populated areas.
