**Regression Analysis**

This analysis seeks to model the relationships between key predictors and the target variable, MHLTH_CrudePrev (mental health prevalence). Regression analysis quantifies these relationships, identifies significant features influencing mental health outcomes, and evaluates the predictive power of multiple models. By doing so, we aim to provide actionable insights for policymakers to target specific risk factors effectively.

**Choice of Regression Models**

To capture linear relationships and handle multicollinearity, we employed the following regression models:

1. Linear Regression: A baseline model for understanding basic relationships between predictors and the target variable.
2. Ridge Regression: Introduces L2 regularization to reduce the influence of collinear predictors and prevent overfitting.
3. Lasso Regression: Uses L1 regularization for feature selection by shrinking less important coefficients to zero.

**Methodology**

**Data Preparation**

- The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values, standardize numerical features, and encode categorical variables.
- Numerical features were scaled using StandardScaler, and categorical variables were one-hot encoded to create a high-dimensional feature matrix.
- The final dataset contained 5,289 rows and 76 features after cleaning.

**Regression Techniques**

- Linear Regression - Fits a simple linear model without regularization, serving as a baseline for comparison.
- Ridge Regression - Includes L2 regularization to minimize overfitting and improve generalization by penalizing large coefficients.
- Lasso Regression - Applies L1 regularization to enforce sparsity in coefficients, which is beneficial for feature selection in high-dimensional data.

**Assumption Testing**

Assumptions for linear regression were verified:

- Linearity: Examined using scatter plots between predictors and the target variable.
- Homoscedasticity: Residual plots indicated constant variance across predictions.
- Multicollinearity: Regularization in Ridge and Lasso addressed issues of multicollinearity effectively.
- Normality: Residuals were approximately normal, as assessed through visualizations.

**Results**

**Model Performance Metrics**:

- **Linear Regression**:
  - Cross-validation scores: \[-0.00446, -0.00231, -0.00073\], mean CV score: -0.00165.
  - Indicates poor performance with potential overfitting or underfitting.
- **Ridge Regression**:
  - Cross-validation scores: \[0.9923, 0.9940, 0.9931\], mean CV score: 0.9934.
  - Outperformed other models with high predictive accuracy and better generalization.
- **Lasso Regression**:
  - Cross-validation scores: \[-0.00446, -0.00231, -0.00073\], mean CV score: -0.00165.
  - Similar to Linear Regression, indicating potential underfitting due to aggressive feature selection.

**Residual Analysis**:

- **Linear Regression**: Residuals were evenly scattered around zero but had a wider spread, indicating an acceptable fit with room for improvement.
- **Ridge Regression**: Residuals were tighter and evenly distributed, demonstrating better control over overfitting.
- **Lasso Regression**: Residuals had a wider spread, suggesting underfitting due to over-regularization.

**Regularization Insights**:

- Ridge regression's regularization resulted in smaller, more stable coefficients without eliminating features entirely.
- Lasso regression aggressively selected features, which might have excluded some important variables, leading to potential loss of predictive power.

**Key Findings**

**Significant Predictors:** Ridge regression identified multiple significant predictors, including cognitive health (COGNITION_CrudePrev) and depression prevalence (DEPRESSION_CrudePrev).

**Model Performance:** Ridge regression achieved the highest R-squared score and outperformed other models in predictive accuracy.

**Regularization Impact:** Ridge addressed multicollinearity effectively, while Lasso’s aggressive feature selection resulted in underfitting.

**Limitations and Future Work**

**Model Limitations:**

- Linear regression struggled with multicollinearity and high-dimensional data.
- Lasso regression’s tendency to underfit highlights the need to tune its hyperparameters further.

**Future Work:**

- Explore more complex models such as ElasticNet, which combines L1 and L2 regularization.
- Include interaction terms or nonlinear transformations to capture more complex relationships.
- Validate models on external datasets to ensure generalizability.
